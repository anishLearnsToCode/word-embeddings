# Creating Word Embeddings Using The CBoW (Continuous Bag of Words) Model

We will first introduce the Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) Model in 
[this Jupyter Notebook]()
and then implement it on a small dataset consisting of textual data from Shakespeare
Novels and create word embeddings for a few words
[in this Notebook]().

We will then use pre-trained word embeddings from the standard 
__word2vc__ implementation by _Google_ and show how we can perform PCA (Principal 
Component Analysis) on our word embeddings. We also show how to perform logical 
comparisons and Language Translation using word embeddings in 
[this Notebook]().
